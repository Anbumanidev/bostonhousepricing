🏠 Boston House Pricing Prediction
This project is an end-to-end implementation of a machine learning pipeline to predict house prices in Boston, based on various features. It demonstrates the complete workflow from data preprocessing and model building to deployment.

📌 Project Overview
Goal: Build and deploy a regression model to predict the median value of owner-occupied homes in Boston.

Tech stack: Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Flask, Heroku.

Deployment: The final trained model is deployed as a web application so users can predict house prices by entering input features.
